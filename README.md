## Introduction
Welcome to Boo Land Cafe! 
Are you ready to order?

## Game Concept
Have the spooky experience of managing a cafe filled with gluttonous ghosts. 
Hire ghosts to work in your café, earn Boo Coins, and unlock more spooky café features.

## Game Goal
The goal of the game is to earn Boo Coins to upgrade the café as the game continues. 

## Target Audience
Mobile and casual players

## Game Genre
Idle, Café Management

## Gameplay
The game starts on the ground level and has three main rooms: Lounge, Kitchen, and Scullery. By swiping left and right, the player can pass between these rooms. 
As the game progresses, new areas are unlocked: the upper floors of the café. The player can pass between different areas by swiping up and down.

## Mechanics

### Earning Money
The money unit we are using in this game is Boo Coin. This is the only valid money unit you can use across the Boo Land.
The player can earn money by selling food items to customers. The lounge is the only room in which one can earn money.
The price of the items is standard, but through upgrading, the player can increase the income.
This standard price can decrease if the customer ghosts wait too long (e.g., -5 coins for each second).
That is why it is essential to upgrade the rooms and employees constantly.

### Upgrading 
The player can upgrade the employees and the rooms using the same user interface. Each room has its upgrade function screen. In this screen, we can see the level of the room and many upgrade actions, as you can see in the Figure 1.

#### Lounge: 
Upgrading waiters’ movement speed
Hiring one more waiter

#### Kitchen:

### Unlocking New Floors
After reaching some point in the game, the player can open the upper floor of the Boo Land Café building. To unlock the first floor, the player must pay a hefty sum and get the minimum level, say, 15, in each room. (The requirements for the second floor might be doubled.)
The player must start from scratch in this new place, similar to the first floor. The UI for the upgrade screen will stay the same. The floors' interior design will be different, and the starting prices of the food served here will be higher than on the previous floor.
### Characters
Even though they are ghosts, the citizens of Boo Land are called Boos (Boo in singular form) instead of ghosts.
### Employees
There are three types of employees: 
#### Waiter Boo – Lounge 
These employees are expected to serve customers and collect dishes from the Lounge. They carry the collected dirty dishes to the counter between the Lounge and the Scullery.  We see them mainly in the Lounge.

#### Chef Boo – Kitchen 
They are responsible for cooking. We can see them mainly in the lounge.

#### Scullion Boo – Scullery
They are responsible for loading the dishwasher. They carry the dishes between the counter and the dishwasher. 

#### Customers
The customers of the Boo Land Café are ghosts, so we are going to use cute hand-made ghost models with a variety of accessories. [insert pictures here]
